                <p>i know you'll never read this, but i need to say it somewhere. 
                i ruined the best thing that ever happened to me. i was so afraid 
                of getting hurt that i hurt you first. i see you're doing well now, 
                and i'm happy for you, even though it kills me. i hope someday 
                i can forgive myself for losing you.</p>
